# Who-am-I
A little bit information about myself. 
To learn, I need to push myself in the things that I cannot usually did. Getting out from my comfort zone lead my decision to think wisely always especially these present environment is not the same I grew up before. Today, I have no specific reasons on what are the things that I interested to learn because as long as that it caught my attention, I want to work it out just to understand and applied it technically. For the meantime, my favorite hobby is to go always in face to face classes by hoping that it can enhance my technical skills and knowledge for my future. Due of 2 years in pandemic without personal interaction with both classmate and teachers. Even though I really want to learn and grow with my course, it's really hard to do it.
