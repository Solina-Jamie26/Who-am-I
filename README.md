# Who-am-I
A little bit information about myself. 
To learn, I need to push myself in the things that I don't usually do. Getting out of my comfort zone lead my decisions to always think wisely, especially in the present environment which is not the same where I developed myself. Today, I have no specific reasons on what are the things that I'm interested to learn, because as long as it caughts my attention, I want to work it out to further understand and apply it technically. For the meantime, my favorite hobby is to go always in face to face classes by hoping that it can enhance the technical skills and knowledge I possess for my future due of 2 years in pandemic without personal interaction with both classmate and teachers. Even though I really want to learn and grow with my course, it's really hard to do it.
